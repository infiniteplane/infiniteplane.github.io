I'm a Rackham Merit Fellow and a PhD candidate in Applied and Interdisciplinary Mathematics at the University of Michigan. My thesis project studies the semiclassical limit of the defocusing Schr&ouml;dinger equation with nonzero boundary conditions. More broadly, I enjoy working on problems from integrable systems, asymptotic analysis, and numerical analysis.
