 I'm a Rackham Merit Fellow and a PhD Candidate at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My thesis project studies the semiclassical limit of the decofusing nonlinear Schr&ouml;dinger equation with nonzero boundary conditions. More broadly, I enjoy working on problems in integrable systems, asymptotic analysis, and numerical analysis.
